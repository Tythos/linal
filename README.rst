linal
=====

JavaScript linear algebra library for vector and matrix operations.
Require.js/AMD-compatible, with the eventual goal of porting to WASM. For this
reason, and because other JavaScript numeric libraries seem to be in poor state
of maintenance, emphasis is on ease-of-use in browser environments and
completeness over Node.js/NPM compatibility and performance.
